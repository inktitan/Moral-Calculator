Learning

just stuff I am throwing together for practice
Hello,
  I am mostly a newb at programming. I am practiciung C++ as a hobby in my free time. I would like to make practicle applications
  at the moment I am mostly on doing various calculators. it has been sugested that i use github. so here I am. I am also not 
  exactly sure how to use github so I'll be figuring that out as well. Thanks for browsing my code and feel free to leave feed back
  or however it works.
  
  So this project is something i was working as ameans to gauge the morality of an action. It meant to be 
  used as if you are commiting the act. Obviously it will be built around my personal biases. Coloboration would help iron
  that out or make it worse. It would be neat if something like this could be used to influence AI beyond Asimov's Three rules. I now humble ambitions. hahaha.
